r.974 version 0.10.0
  - added SimulationRunner, that can start/stop or perform singleLoop of simulation in separate thread.
  - Maybe some signal capability will be added to SimulationRunner, so that something can be notified when singleLoop is finished during calculations.

r.972
  - GLSimulationPlayerviewer - change of function call, because qglviewer 2.2 has changed a function name: added compilation flag: QGLVIEWER20
  - OpenGLRenderingEngine - latest version of libglut3d requires to call glutInit(): added compilation flags: NO_GLUTINIT

r.970
  - Threadable class has been removed:
  - when yade is idle 0% of CPU is consumed by the display,
  - when simulation is ran it is in separate thread, second processor (if present) is drawing on the screen,
  - with two processors theoretically QtGUI should have speed equal to NullGUI,
  - drawing on the screen is not synchronized, so some bodies are from previous iteration, some are from next iteration (later there will be an option to turn synchronization ON - it will slow down computations a bit)
  - This implementation is stil not 100% tested, please report if there are any problems. Especially if there is a segfault on exit. Press enter in each graphical view to start/stop updating it.

r.960
  - 'cancel' when loading filegenerator is not crashing now
  - started non-local model for lattice
  - hopefully 2d lattice beams are now okay.
  - middle button in 3d view is now "PAN" command, not "ZOOM" as it used to be. It's more similar to AutoCAD
  - 'yade -h' will now display compilation flags (currently only DOUBLE_PRECISION - how about adding long double ;) ?)

r.957
  - added function Quaternion::power(RealType)
  - lattice bending works now in 2d (X-Y plane), using angles. not vectors or quaternions. I will do 3d later.

r.956
  - fixed serious bug in bool BodyRedirectionVector::erase(unsigned int);
  - added function bool exists() const; to BodyContainer
  - graphical display now has reversed meaning of scrollwheel, so it is now similar to behaviour of blender and autocad
  - SDECLinkedSpheres is working after some (surprise!) quick hack. That part is still waiting for total rewrite.
  - big improvements in lattice model. beam bending works (but not always) with axis+angle notation. maybe with quaternions it will be better. There is a problem that shows itself when using regular triangular grid.

r.955 version 0.9.8
  - NullGUI displays help when called without arguments
  - fixed serious problem in OpenGLRenderingEngine's constructor - there were hardoced plugin names. now the list is built dynamically
  - configurable path to preferences, not forcing users to use ~/.yade/
  - QtGUI is now saving the configuration of RenderingEngine, so for example background color is remembered now.
  - 'Load' and 'Save' in FileGenerator works
  - added yadeVersionName to Omega - so that all plugins can query it to correcly display version, which is set by main(), and general cleaning of the mess in main(), yade.cpp
  - fixed handling of pointer to simulationController in YadeQtMainWindow.cpp
  - lattice model based on rods works great
  - add a FIXME in XMLFormatManager, beginDesrialization : rootBody can load FileGenerator, because is not checking names

r.954 version 0.9.7
  - NullGUI can save to binary format
  - graphical windows GLViewer displays a grid with cell size exacly 1 meter or 1 cm (depending on the model size) previously that grid had some random size, which was totally useless
  - added DisplacementEngine derived from DeuxExMachina - is like translation, but without velocity - purely kinematic displacement.
  - disorder parameters in FileGenerators SDECSpheresPlane and LatticeExample are now Vector3r, so that we can specify different randomness in each direction. This is useful for flat 2D simulations
  - major improvements to lattice model (rod model is working)

r.953 version 0.9.6
  - binary serialization for yade
  - fixed one bug in BINFormatManager
  - fixed saving ElasticContactParameters and SpheresContactGeometry, so that after loading the simulation is not going crazy
  - removed GLAPI and GLAPIENTRY from OpenGLWrapper
  - XMLSaxParser is now better at counting lines

r.951 version 0.9.5
  - can save simulation from simulation controller
  - can change background color of the simulation displayed

r.950
  - QtEngineEditor is not working - doesn't detect correctly StandAloneEngines
  - there was a collision between PersistentSAPCollider and PersistentSAPCollider from yade-extra, renamed second one to PersistentAloneSAPCollider

r.949 version 0.9.4
  - added: StandAloneEngine.hpp, InteractionSolver.hpp, DataRecorder.hpp, BroadInteractor.hpp - to have a nicer and easier to navigate class diagram
  - fixed drawing of bounding volumes inside rootBody

r.948 version 0.9.3
  - MetaBody::actors -> engines
  - GLDrawInteractionBox -> GLDrawInteractingBox
  - GLDrawInteractionGeometryFunctor -> GLDrawInteractingGeometryFunctor

  - Box2Sphere4MacroMicroContactGeometry -> InteractingBox2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry
  - Sphere2Sphere4ClosestFeatures -> InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4ClosestFeatures
  - Sphere2Sphere4ErrorTolerant -> InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4ErrorTolerantContact
  - Sphere2Sphere4MacroMicroContactGeometry -> InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry
  - Box2AABB -> InteractingBox2AABB
  - Sphere2AABB -> InteractingSphere2AABB

r.938 version 0.9.2
  - added SDECMovingWall FileGenerator contributed by Andreas Plesch.
  - cleaned all .cpp files. they are all now less cluttered and easier/shorter to read.
  - So I have started compiling it on windows, and I stopped on the problem that linker cannot link serialization with factory.


r.917 version 0.9.1
  - SimulationPlayer - can play recorded position/orientation data
  - QtSimulationPlayer
  - SphericalDEMSimulator - a separate version of DEM calculations without all "yade burden" to make speed comparisons

r.914
  - new version of docs, checked by my sister.

r.904 yade-core version 0.9.0
  - split of packages done. Now each package can be developed separately and has own version numbers.

  - huge improvement in Makefile. 'make compile_install' and yade is ready to release to the wild world.
  - some class renamed to better reflect their functions,
  - some cleaning,
  - Simulation loop editing through GUI starts to work,
  - added REGSITER_BASE_CLASS_NAME, so we can build class tree on runtime (used by simulation loop GUI),
  - removed all references from Serialization stuff to yade-lib-multimethod as they are totally unrelated,
  - plugins of yade containers are now using ::iterator, just like STL !
  - Tetrahedron Discrete Model, and Lattice Discrete Model start to work, but not good enough to increment a major revision number.
  - FEM, DEM, Mass Spring and Rigid Body are working good.

r.817
  added REGSITER_BASE_CLASS_NAME, so we can build class tree on runtime.

r.815
  Improvements in QtEngineEditor. Now it is almost possible to create graphically a simultation loop.Now I have to make something to set parameter of MetaEngines.

r.812 (*)
  Better design : added class related to MetaEngine. Removed all references to Serialization stuff into yade-lib-multimethod. They are now into newly added classes.

r.809 (*)
  plugin containers for yade use ::iterator, just like STL !

r.808
  I have introduced iterators for all types of containers in order to remove the dirty gotoFirst, gotoNext, hasNext and notAtEnd methods. Now it looks like more like STL iterators. It is compiling but unfortunately it is segfaulting at runtime, probably some problems in ++,* operators.

r.804
  Better YadeQtMainWindow. Now menus are displayed in menu bar in the same order they are added in the program. Added preferences for QtGUI. Now it remembers size and position and exit. Now it is possible to choose time step from GUI.

  - All those extra environment variables are no longer needed. Currently only LD_LIBRARY_PATH is used by dlopen. Dunno how to remove it.
  - added user manual to doc/, without pictures, and still a draft.
  - Small change so that yade is compiling with qglviewer 2.0
  - Updates in Omega : now foreach plugins we store if it is indexable, factorable or serializable.
  - Improved GUI for code generation : Data class, engine and dispatching engine works. No stuff is done for generation of kdevelop projects.

r.691 (*)
  Added some dynlibs for handling swept sphere volume.

r.690
  To make yade deserialization working I had to modify PointerHandler.tpp around line 90. Basically I just replaced a dynamic_cast by a reinterpret_cast. We have to find why dynamic_cast is not working anymore.

r.510 (*)
  better openGL tetrahedron display. created empty directories for splitting to packages.

r.486 version 0.8.0
  tagging v.0.8.0
  - FEM works!

r.482
  FEM is half done - generation works. and other stuff. Only Constitutive Law for FEM is empty - waiting to be written. But there is a compilation problem we have to compile twice now, because of linker errors in fem loader.

r.481
  ComplexBody has now actors and initializers, and thanks to that FEMSetTextLoaderFunctor is working. loading terrain from VRML file will work in a similar way that FEMSetTextLoaderFunctor

r.480 version 0.7.5
  tagging v.0.7.5
  - Quite stable version used for course (teaching how to use yade) with Frederic, Emmanuel and Julien.

r.470
  FEMBeam loads the file correctly

r.435
  fixed stupid and embarassing error when calculating sphere volume. All physical results are totally different now. comparing results again with SDEC.

r.434
  Body::group changed into Body::groupMask (so bodies can belong to many groups - max. 16 groups, because we have 16 bits here). added fem.beam, so that we can start with FEM

r.432
  started lattice model. Generation works.

r.430
  Splitted leapfrog integrator into two parts (position and orientation)

r.427
  internal shearing angle is added, and yade is ready to compare results with
  sdec, although force recorder is little dirty, because it is releasing the big ball

r.426 version 0.7.3
  tagging v.0.7.3
  - RotatingBox example with spheres and boxes inside is working quite good - with SimpleSpringDynamicEngine.
  - BoxStack example is working quite good. meybe it should be renamed to WallImpact.
  - the real name for damping is: Cundall Non Viscous Local Damping.
  - TimeStepper is working quite nice, and now - even SDECLinkedSpheres example is stable.
  - SDECParameters is now holding shearingAngle, young modulus and posions ratio - as it should. 
  - timestepper is working good with that. All examples filegenerators exept FEM are working!

r.419
  added ActionReset - it is not inside SDECDynamicEngine - because for cloth example we have two/three engines, so they can't do a reset - because they will delete results from other engine
  also changed arguments to InteractionGeometryFunctor - from shared_ptr<Interaction>& to const shared_ptr<Interaction>&, because InteractionContainer is returning cont reference. So by passing this const& - we avoid making extra copy of shared_ptr so it is faster - lot of files were changed.
  I also started separating computation of InteractionGeometry and InteractionPhysics for permanent links. Currently this calculation is inside SDECDynamicEngine ! it is very bad, and must be moved outside, because for lattice model I want to make those calculations in a clean way - outside of dynamic engine. To do that I had to modify dispatcher - so now dispatcher is doing two loops - one over permanentInteractions and second over interactions. So this dirty part of deleting duplicated interactions was moved from SDECDynamicEngine to InteractionGeometryDispatcher. It is still dirty and must be solved, but now it is dirty outside of dynamic engine, so it is possible to work on dynamic engine in a clean way.

r.417 version 0.7.2
  tagging v.0.7.2
  - damping is separated from SDECDynamicEngine and works, strange is that ActionDampingDispatcher and ActionApplyDispatcher are exactly the same! so they should be merged into one dispatcher. maybe Action2BodyPhysicalParametersDispatcher

r.416 version 0.7.1
  tagging v.0.7.1
  - I have done some general cleaning - removed unnecessary constructors, deleted unused postProcessAttributes, etc..
  - FunctorWrapper is Serializable, now - because we want Dispatcher to work with serialization, so that Functors can get extra arguments from .xml

r.413

r.410
  finished all renaming. update of GeometricalModel for cloth is working

r.407
  OK/Cancel works now in file selection dialog, 
  ActionForce2RigidBody was deleted, because ActionForce2Particle does the same job 
  now I'm starting to work on updating GeometricalModel of Mesh2D, so that cloth will be displayed properly

r.406
  I have done some general cleaning - removed unnecessary constructors, deleted unused postProcessAttributes, etc.. and I have discovered that when class has no virtual destructor then dunamic_cast fails! I wanted to remove all unused destructor, and then all dynamic_cast were failing. So instead I added virtual destructor everywhere :)

r.399
  We have now: ( <- means 'aggregates' )
  Interaction <- InteractionGeometry
  Interaction <- InteractionPhysics
  Body <- BodyPhysicalParameters
  Body <- BoundingVolume
  Body <- GeometricalModel
  Body <- InteractionDescription

r.366
  HangingCloth is working again but it is designed adhering to Yade framework.

r.355
  InteractionPhysicsDispatcher starts to works. But we have to make BodyPhysics

r.352 (*) (****) version 0.6.7
  tagging v.0.6.7
  - small change in ActionDispatcher.cpp, is faster, but if Action was holding body's id it is possible that it can be faster result: 107 seconds is faster compared to 111 seconds
  - tere are a lot of places where we can do improvement like this. if we do code change like here - in every possible places - yade can gain a lot of speed.
  - basically I've discovered that every temporary variable of type shared_ptr<> costs 3 seconds, so we should avoid creating them and instead pass them around by references - whenever possible. 
  - And very iportant to note is that this speed improvement is possible ONLY because we have introduced Action, which is more generic! without this class it would be impossible to get faster. So it means that good generic code allows faster code - at least sometimes - as we have example if this here. The same was with containers - introducing containers made code slower, but it made possible to make improvements in other places (because containers increased genericity) and as a result the code got faster.

r.351
  renamed CollisionFunctor to InteractionFunctor

r.345 version 0.6.6
  tagging v.0.6.6
  - possibly faster DynLibDispatcher, 
  - I was also trying to fix problem that Singleton is not deleted at end, but finally I made only some improvement, but it is still not fixed.
