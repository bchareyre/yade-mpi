		- several python interface improvements
		- add code for plotting histogram of interaction directions
		- added buttons for looking from different directions
		- new contact algorithm for facets

	* RELEASE: 0.12

	* User interface:

		- Refactored Qt3 interface: MDI with simulation running
		  asynchronously, with python console

		- Python wrapper and console with the ability to control most
		  simulation aspects (including creating simulations,
		  modifying, inspecting, running, recording data), some parts
		  of the UI (setting view, configuring renderer); see
		  scripts/simple-scene.py to get started
		  (http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/SimpleSceneTutorial)

		- Much enhanced simulation recorder and player, saving
		  optionally to a single file (sqlite database), the ability to
		  create video from simulation with one command (may be done
		  offscreen as well): scripts/simple-scene-player.py,
		  http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/New:Making_videos

	* Graphical Viewer:

		- up to 3 clipping planes in the GLViewer, can be manipulated,
		  bound to each other, activated/deactivated

		- saving view to view configurations inside MetaBody (Alt+7 --
		  Alt+9), can be loaded later (from python as well)

		- displacement and rotation scaling in GLViewer, using
		  PhysicalParameters::refSe3

	* Simulation features:

		- New moment rotation law, fully tested and working

		- All simulation aspects (dt, iteration, virtual time) are now
		  inside MetaBody, i.e. are restored exactly as they were from
		  .xml

		- Much improved triaxial test

		- Lattice model can now simulate concrete with steel fibres
	
	* New, experimental features:

		- Selectively block any of 6 DOFs ( translation and rotation)
		  for individual bodies (PhysicalParameters::blockedDOFs - not
		  documented, not conveniently accessible from python
		  yet)

		- Plotting interface based on pylab see example in
		  scripts/simple-scene-graph.py

		- Sega's facets and vertices with stl import (for example
		  import shapes from blender)
	
	* Serialization:

		- Transparent support for compressed .xml.gz and .xml.bz2
		  files; dropped support for binary format

		- The (de)serializer now (un)escapes all control characters,
		  using the &charname; format, arbitrary string values can be
		  de/serialized now, including parentheses, quotations marks,
		  newlines, tabs, <>.

	* Compilation / Development:

		- Compilation profiles allow separate option sets for scons;
		  simultaneous compilation of multiple profiles is supported
		  via the profile=a,b,c
		
		- QGLViewer source is now in our tree, no need to install it
		  separately
