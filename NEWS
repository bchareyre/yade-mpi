2009-08-?? Václav Šmilauer <eudoxos@arcig.cz> revision 19??

	* RELEASE: 0.20.0

	* overall: 
		- fix many crashers, including synchronization with openGL, GUI and python
		- generate documentation for both python and c++ classes/functions automatically (http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Reference_documentation)
		- move away from SVN repository at berlios.de to bzr at http://www.launchpad.net/yade; bug tracking and other launchpad features are being used; mailing lists migrated to launchpad

	* functionality enhancements (apart from performance-oriented changes):
		- Facets (arbitrary triangulation elements) interacting with spheres, allowing to triangulate any surface
		- support for GTS-compatible triangulated surfaces both as predicates and facet-triangulated simulation elements
		- non-incremental sphere-sphere and sphere-facet contact geometry classes (Dem3DofGeom)
		- ConstitutiveLawDispatcher, for having multiple constitutive laws operating on different interactions
		- schedule to run multiple jobs at time, with different parameters (yade-multi, http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/ScriptParametricStudy)
		- added PhysicalParameters::blockedDOFs
		- periodic boundary conditions
		- interaction logic cleaned up
		- sphere packing generators (orthogonal, hexagonal, loose random, triaxially compacted; periodic coming soon)
		- geometry predicates to clip packing, including boolean operations on predicates
		- infrastructure for regression tests

	* performance:
		- consistent openMP support throughout the code (InteractionDispatchers, NewtonsDampedLaw, BexContainer) (http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Performance_Tuning#openMP)
		- InsertionSortCollider (PersistentSAPCollide removed) (http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Colliders_performace)
		- InteractionDispatchers that reduce number of loops over interactions to one (http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Performance_Tuning#InteractionDispatchers)
		- new fast container for interactions (InteractionVecMap) (http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Performance_Tuning#Containers)
		- caching dispatchers, avoiding repetitive multivirtual call resolution (http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Performance_Tuning#Dispatcher_cache)
		- runtime profiling information (http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Speed_profiling_using_TimingInfo_and_TimingDeltas_classes)
		- avoid running collision detection at every step (http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Insertion_Sort_Collider_Stride)
		- vector and quaternion classes are wrapped in python automatically (faster, avoids hand-written wrappers)
		- removed many python proxy classes, resulting in big speedup of python (e.g. 40 × for some operations)

	* building:
		- yade can be optionally with one single plugin containing all packages. Speeds up full compilation considerably and reduces binary size several times.
		- files in pkg/* are picked up automatically by the build system, including linking flags
		- do not install headers, only plugins
		- fix debian-package builds and document the procedure (http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/DebianPackages), special package for docs
		- fix all (or most) compile-time warnings
		- create new top-level py/ directory for python

	* python:
		- use natural syntax for class instance construction with attributes
		- run telnet server to make yade accessible while running (from localhost only)
		- save any python variables within the XML file, which will be resurrected next time (utils.saveVars, utils.loadVars)
		- support saving simulation to memory temporarily
		- functions from creating video from simulation (via snapshots, either during simulation or in the player)


2008-08-20 Janek Kozicki <cosurgi@gmail.com> revision 1579

	* RELEASE: 0.12.1
	
		- several python interface improvements
		- add code for plotting histogram of interaction directions
		- added buttons for looking from different directions
		- new contact algorithm for facets
		- added python script for making videos
		- added a TCP server on port 9000 with python console in it
		- new dependency on python-numpy package, which allows faster math in python
		- added a script for parametric studies


2008-08-20 Janek Kozicki <cosurgi@gmail.com> revision 1486

	* RELEASE: 0.12

	* User interface:

		- Refactored Qt3 interface: MDI with simulation running
		  asynchronously, with python console

		- Python wrapper and console with the ability to control most
		  simulation aspects (including creating simulations,
		  modifying, inspecting, running, recording data), some parts
		  of the UI (setting view, configuring renderer); see
		  scripts/simple-scene.py to get started
		  (http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/SimpleSceneTutorial)

		- Much enhanced simulation recorder and player, saving
		  optionally to a single file (sqlite database), the ability to
		  create video from simulation with one command (may be done
		  offscreen as well): scripts/simple-scene-player.py,
		  http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/New:Making_videos

	* Graphical Viewer:

		- up to 3 clipping planes in the GLViewer, can be manipulated,
		  bound to each other, activated/deactivated

		- saving view to view configurations inside MetaBody (Alt+7 --
		  Alt+9), can be loaded later (from python as well)

		- displacement and rotation scaling in GLViewer, using
		  PhysicalParameters::refSe3

	* Simulation features:

		- New moment rotation law, fully tested and working

		- All simulation aspects (dt, iteration, virtual time) are now
		  inside MetaBody, i.e. are restored exactly as they were from
		  .xml

		- Much improved triaxial test

		- Lattice model can now simulate concrete with steel fibres
	
	* New, experimental features:

		- Selectively block any of 6 DOFs ( translation and rotation)
		  for individual bodies (PhysicalParameters::blockedDOFs - not
		  documented, not conveniently accessible from python
		  yet)

		- Plotting interface based on pylab see example in
		  scripts/simple-scene-graph.py

		- Sega's facets and vertices with stl import (for example
		  import shapes from blender)
	
	* Serialization:

		- Transparent support for compressed .xml.gz and .xml.bz2
		  files; dropped support for binary format

		- The (de)serializer now (un)escapes all control characters,
		  using the &charname; format, arbitrary string values can be
		  de/serialized now, including parentheses, quotations marks,
		  newlines, tabs, <>.

	* Compilation / Development:

		- Compilation profiles allow separate option sets for scons;
		  simultaneous compilation of multiple profiles is supported
		  via the profile=a,b,c
		
		- QGLViewer source is now in our tree, no need to install it
		  separately
