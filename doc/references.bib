There has been a number of contact detection algorithms with total detection time proportional to N ln(N) (where N is the total number of separate bodies) reported in the past. In more recent years algorithms with total CPU time proportional to N have been developed. In this work, a novel contact detection algorithm with total detection time proportional to N is proposed. The performance of the algorithm is not influenced by packing density, while memory requirements are insignificant. The algorithm is applicable to systems comprising bodies of a similar size. The algorithm is named MR (Munjiza-Rougier: Munjiza devised the algorithm, Rougier implemented it). In the second part of the paper the algorithm is extended to particles of different sizes. The new algorithm is called MMR (multi-step MR) algorithm."

In this work a contact detection algorithm with total detection time proportional to N is reported. The algorithm is termed NBS, which stands for no binary search. In other words, the proposed algorithm involves no binary search at any stage. In addition the performance of the algorithm in terms of total detection time is not influenced by packing density, while memory requirements are insignificant. The only limitation of the algorithm is its applicability to the systems comprising bodies of similar size."

	abstract = "In this paper we propose a new algorithm to simulate the dynamics of 3-D interacting rigid bodies. Six degrees of freedom are introduced to describe a single 3-D body or particle, and six relative motions and interactions are permitted between bonded bodies. We develop a new decomposition technique for 3-D rotation and pay particular attention to the fact that an arbitrary relative rotation between two coordinate systems or two rigid bodies can not be decomposed into three mutually independent rotations around three orthogonal axes. However, it can be decomposed into two rotations, one pure axial rotation around the line between the centers of two bodies, and another rotation on a specified plane controlled by another parameter. These two rotations, corresponding to the relative axial twisting and bending in our model, are sequence-independent. Therefore all interactions due to the relative translational and rotational motions between linked bodies can be uniquely determined using such a two-step decomposition technique. A complete algorithm for one such simulation is presented. Compared with existing methods, this algorithm is physically more reliable and has greater numerical accuracy.",

Thereby, the constitutive equations of both approaches will be based onVoigtshypothesis defining the strain state on the individual microplanes as well as the relative particle displacements. Through an appropriate constitutive assumption, the microplane stresses and the contact forces can be determined. In both cases, the equivalence of microscopic and macroscopic virtual work yields the overall stress strain relation. An elastic and an elasto-plastic material characterization of the microplane model and the particle model are derived and similarities of both approaches are illustrated.",
