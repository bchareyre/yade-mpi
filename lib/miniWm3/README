This directory contains direct copy of a part of WildMagick3p11 (http://www.geometrictools.com). The only file that altered is Wm3FoundationPCH.h, which is just empty here.

* NOTE: to support long double aka quad precision, most *.cpp files have templace specializations for that type added

Due to building issues, its non-availability as Debian packages and considerable size of the original library, of which yade uses only a fraction, we decided to ship and build a local copy.

Upstream source license is LGPL.
