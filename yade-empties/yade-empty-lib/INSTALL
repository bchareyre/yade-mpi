INSTALLING:

to compile and install this library execute following commands:

	make
	make install
	make clean		# to clean afterwards

by default everything is installed in directory /usr/local, if for example
you want to install in /usr instead, you can do this:

	make install INSTALL_DIR='/usr'

Or if you are a package maintaner, you may want to install everything in
different directory tree:

	make install PREFIX_DIR='/tmp/foo' INSTALL_DIR='/usr'



DOCUMENTATION:

for documentation check doc/ directory, maybe there is something useful.
