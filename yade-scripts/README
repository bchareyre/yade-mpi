In this directory are placed scripts that help managing yade project.


Due to many changes in yade directory structure and design many of those
scripts no longer work, and need some modifications or can be deleted.
I can't test everything now, but I don't want to delete them (even though
they will be in subversion history). 
So working scripts are in this directory, all other scripts are in
directory 'untested'

Olivier: if you test any of those scripts from 'untested', please move
it back to yade-scripts. After some time we will delete obsolete
scripts from 'untested'.

                                                     / Janek /


usually scripts should be invoked from different directory than
trunk/yade-scripts


TESTED SCRIPTS:

setDebug , 
setRelease        : invoke from trunk/
                    switch between debug and release

svndiff num1 num2 : prints svn diff between revisions num1 and num2. useful in
                    connection with kompare:
		      svndiff 800 820 > tmpfile ; kompare tmpfile

makeFlat          : invoke from trunk/
                    make symlinks of all source files (.cpp, .tpp, .h, .c, .ipp)
		    in yade-flat.
