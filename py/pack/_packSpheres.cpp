		"\nSphere radius distribution can be specified using one of the following ways:\n\n#. *rMean*, *rRelFuzz* and *num* gives uniform radius distribution in *rMean×(1 ± rRelFuzz)*. Less than *num* spheres can be generated if it is too high.\n#. *rRelFuzz*, *num* and (optional) *porosity*, which estimates mean radius so that *porosity* is attained at the end.  *rMean* must be less than 0 (default). *porosity* is only an initial guess for the generation algorithm, which will retry with higher porosity until the prescibed *num* is obtained.\n#. *psdSizes* and *psdCumm*, two arrays specifying points of the `particle size distribution <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_size_distribution>`__ function. As many spheres as possible are generated.\n#. *psdSizes*, *psdCumm*, *num*, and (optional) *porosity*, like above but if *num* is not obtained, *psdSizes* will be scaled down uniformly, until *num* is obtained (see :yref:`appliedPsdScaling<yade._packSpheres.SpherePack.appliedPsdScaling>`).\n\nBy default (with ``distributeMass==False``), the distribution is applied to particle radii. The usual sense of \"particle size distribution\" is the distribution of *mass fraction* (rather than particle count); this can be achieved with ``distributeMass=True``."
		"\n\nIf *num* is defined, then sizes generation is deterministic, giving the best fit of target distribution. It enables spheres placement in descending size order, thus giving lower porosity than the random generation."

The algorithm will be retrying until the number of generated spheres is *num*. The first iteration tries with the provided porosity, but next iterations increase it if necessary (hence an initialy high porosity can speed-up the algorithm). If *psdSizes* is not defined, *rRelFuzz* ($z$) and *num* ($N$) are used so that the porosity given ($\\rho$) is approximately achieved at the end of generation, $r_m=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{V(1-\\rho)}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(1+z^2)N}}$.
