Release sources
===============
Go to http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Installation for up-to-date sources.

Latest SVN snapshot
===================
If you want to look at the latest yade version from Launchpad, 
you can download it using one of the ways shown below:

	bzr checkout lp:yade


Which one of those above will work depends on your network and firewall
configuration.

Prequisities
============
All libraries listed below must be installed with development headers. It's
better to install them using your linux's distribution package management
system, instead of downloading directly from the website.

    * boost library >=1.34 with components: date-time, filesystem, thread, regex, algorithm, foreach
    * qt3 library, including multithreading (-mt) component
    * freeglut3 / libglut3 development files
    * g++
    * sqlite3
    * scons build system 

optionally:

    * Ctags
    * Doxygen
    * wildmagic 3.11 - only if you want Delaunay triangulation support in lattice model
    * log4cxx - extensive logging support and debugging
    * python-dev, python-scientific, python-matplotlib, python-numpy - for python scripting interface
	 * gdb

Installation
============

Run this command from inside yade-0.12/ directory to install yade as a local
user without root privileages:

	scons PREFIX=/home/username/YADE optimize=1

(If you have a machine that you are the only user on, you can instead change
permission on /usr/local 
	
	sudo chown username: /usr/local

	scons optimize=1

and still use default paths without special priviledges).

Scons takes many options, see scons -h or http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_details#Scons_options for details.
