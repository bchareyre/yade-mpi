COMPILING CURRENT RELEASE

From yade-all directory level you can install whole yade at once. It's a good
solution when installing yade for the first time. When you install something
next time, it is better to install only from directories that have changed
their version numbers - you will save on compilation time.

To compile and install whole yade execute following commands:

   make compile_install
   make clean            # to clean afterwards

WARNING: command 'make compile_install' is compiling and installing, this is
because compiling next packege requires the previous one to be already
installed otherwise compilation will fail (normally we should invoke 'make &&
make install', so this is an exception).

NOTE: By default everything is installed in directory INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local,
it is however recommended to install yade in your home directory, read on
below:


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDED INSTALLATION METHOD

Because yade is still in early development stage, and most likely you will edit
the sources and recompile, then it is recommended that you install yade as a
user without root privileages (execute this comamnd from inside
yade-all-0.10.0/ directory):

   mkdir ~/YADE
   make compile_install INSTALL_DIR='/YADE' PREFIX_DIR='/home/joeuser'

Remember to replace "joeuser" with your user name.

Read section about starting yade >>.
Remember to add plugin directories as described in first time setup >>.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OTHER COMPILATION VARIANTS

As a root user:

   make compile_install INSTALL_DIR='/usr'

If you are a package maintaner, you may want to install everything in different
directory tree:

   make compile_install PREFIX_DIR='/tmp/foo' INSTALL_DIR='/usr'


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OF YADE COMPILATION OPTIONS

   1. INSTALL_DIR - determines the installation directory, starts with / , ends without /

   2. PREFIX_DIR - determines prefix for installation directory, starts with / , ends without /

   3. CXXFLAGS='-DDOUBLE_PRECISION' - yade is compiled using 'double' as a base
   type for calculation. This gives higher precision than 'float'. On some
   computers it is faster (like AMD64), on others it is slower - this really
   depends on your machine.

   4. CXXFLAGS='-DNO_GLUTINIT' - older versions of libglut do not have function
   glutInit(), you should use this compilation flag then.

   5. CXXFLAGS='-DQGLVIEWER20' - If you are using older QGLViewer (version 2.0)
   you should use this flag, otherwise you will get error about setFileName()


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPILATION NOTES

   1. Both INSTALL_DIR and PREFIX_DIR should start with / and shouldn't have
   trailing slash.

   2. If compilation is interrupted (eg. due to some compilation error), and
   then resumed with different INSTALL_DIR or PREFIX_DIR, then all *.pro files
   (used by qmake) will be damaged (wrong INSTALL_DIR and PREFIX_DIR inside)

   3. If you are compiling with gcc3.3, you need to pass additional argument:

         make compile_install CXXFLAGS='-pthread -lpthread'

   4. flag CXXFLAGS can be used to set some compilation options, like:

         CXXFLAGS='-O3'                     # optimize code for speed
         CXXFLAGS='-pthread -lpthread -O3'  # gcc3.3, and optimize for speed
         CXXFLAGS='-g'                      # debugging symbols - gdb's backtrace can display line numbers
         CXXFLAGS='-DDOUBLE_PRECISION -O3'  # for calculation use double precision instead of float and optimize for speed

   5. If you ever want to uninstall, you can invoke this command (with correct INSTALL_DIR, and PREFIX_DIR):

         make uninstall

   6. AMD64: when compiling on AMD64 an additional -fPIC option is required:
         make compile_install CXXFLAGS='-fPIC -pthread -lpthread -O3' INSTALL_DIR='/YADE' PREFIX_DIR='/home/joeuser'

   7. Fedora core 4: gcc 4 generates an error when it encounters an anonymous enum. It is no longer possible to write

         enum {value = 1 }

      It must be written instead:
         enum enumname {value = 1 }

      Under fedora 4 the default compiler is gcc 4 and some header files from
      stl still contain anonymous enums. You must edit those .h files and give
      any name to those enums. Among other files this must be corrected:
      /usr/include/c++/4.0.?/bits/cpp_type_traits.h, and some of QT headers,
      like qcolor.h. Remember to give different name to each enum. Inside there
      is something like this:

      template<>
          struct __is_integer<bool>
          {
            enum { __value = 1 };
            typedef __true_type __type;
          };

      Replace it with:

      template<>
          struct __is_integer<bool>
          {
            enum enumname1 { __value = 1 };
            typedef __true_type __type;
          };

      In above case the compilation error was reported as:
         .../yade/yade-lib-wm3-math/Math.ipp:53: error:
         `std::__is _integer<double>::<anonymous enum>' is/uses anonymous type

   8. If you get an error:
         glut.so: undefined reference
      you have to edit file yade-core/src/yade/yade.pro and add -lGL and -lGLU at the bottom.

   9. Gentoo: If you get an error:
         GL/freeglut_ext.h: No such file or directory
      You have to replace file glut with freeglut.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STARTING YADE

To start correctly, yade must be able to find its libraries. It means that you
should set LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to the right
directory. Depending on where yade is installed, it can be one of those:

   /usr/local/lib/yade/yade-libs
   /home/joeuser/YADE/lib/yade/yade-libs
   /usr/lib/yade/yade-libs

You can do this in following ways:

   1. add following line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshenv

         export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib/yade/yade-libs

   2. or everytime before you first start yade in a given terminal issue a command:

         export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib/yade/yade-libs

NOTE: csh uses setenv instead of export

If you fail to do what is described above, you will get the following error:

./yade: error while loading shared libraries: libyade-lib-time.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIRST TIME SETUP

After launching yade for the first time, you will be welcomed by 'Yade first
use wizard'. You will be asked questions, and your answers will be saved in the
directory ~/.yade

1. Specify default GUI name [QtGUI] :

You can safely press enter here. Yade can use many different GUI plugins,
currently there are only two: QtGUI and NullGUI. QtGUI is currently a standard
graphical frontend for yade. NullGUI is a command line interface for yade. In
the future more GUIs can appear, like: ncurses based, GTK, etc.

2. Specify the path where to find it [/usr/local/lib/yade/yade-guis] :

Here you should specify path to yade-guis, it can be one of the following:

   /usr/local/lib/yade/yade-guis
   /home/joeuser/YADE/lib/yade/yade-guis
   /usr/lib/yade/yade-guis

Then a graphical window should appear. Next step is to add directories with all
other plugins used by yade. To do so click 'Edit->Preferences->Plugin Folders',
and add all directories from lib/yade/ path. This is a daunting task, since
there are currently 8 directories to add (will be fixed with bug #004858). But
you should do it only once. If you are developing your own plugins, and they
reside in some other directory, you should add this directory here.

Then click 'Plugins' on the left, and click a button 'Rescan'. You should see
all C++ classes that are recognized by yade from those plugins.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILEGENERATORS

Filegenerators are used to generate an input file for yade to simulate
something. Later this section will be extended with explanations on how to
write a new filegenerator. But for now, you can try using some of the existing
ones.

In yade QtGUI click 'Preprocessor->File Generator'.

By default the output file name is ../data/scene.xml. That is because currently
yade is assuming that is is ran from somewhere/bin/ directory, and there exists
a directory named somewhere/data/. This behaviour will change after fixing bug
#004853. For now you can use ../data directory.

Output library name is a serialization plugin used to save the file. Currently
we have only support for XML, but soon binary format will appear.

Generator name is the name of the class used to generate this file. You can
pick anything from the list, and see what it generates. If you happen to write
a new generator plugin, and a path to this plugin was added in preferences,
then it will automatically appear in this drop down list.

Below are parameters that the plugin uses to generate a file.

Finally you can click 'Generate' button. And an output file will be saved.

You can use 'Load' and 'Save' buttons to store various configurations of
currently selected filegenerator.

EXAMPLES

Some of filegenerators described above need an input file which can be found in
yade-examples >>. Currently we have:

- 2 examples for FEM
- 1 example for SDEC Impact test

Other filegenerators work without need for any input file. They generate
examples just by parameters given to them. In the future yade-examples will
contain more.

Put those examples in mentioned above somewhere/data/ directory, so that
filegenerators will find them.

FIRST SIMULATION

Once you have succesfully generated an input file for the simulation (called
../scene.xml by default), you can load and run it. Click 'File->New
Simulation', and you will see a Simulation Controller window. Inside it click
Load and choose scene.xml.

You can manipulate the qglviewer graphical window by dragging and scrolling
with the mouse. To run the simulation click the button play (play).  From now
on you can start exploring yade yourself.
